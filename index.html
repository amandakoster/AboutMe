           <article class="floated_box">My goals with learning code are to include front end web development and a deeper understanding of Agile, UX to my current skill set of visual content powerhouse. I am passionate about building things that work well, and are what users really want. Above all, I care a lot about good design.</article>
           <article class="floated_box">Something was missing. I wanted to keep building things, though I wanted to influence functionality and user experience along with directing visual communication.</article>
           <article class="floated_box">My interest in code began when I really wanted something to be green instead of blue on a Wordpress site. I tweaked the CSS code, it worked, and this piqued my interest. A few years later I was managing a website for a hackathon project and wanted our site to have a cool favicon. I found the code and directions on Wikipedia, entered the code, saved the HTML file and hit refresh. When the red favicon appeared I was stunned. It felt like I had performed magic and wanted more.</article>

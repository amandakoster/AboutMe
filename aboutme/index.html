    <h1>About Amanda Koster</h1>

    <!--quickly learn a few things about me, such as a short bio, my education, an overview of my job experience, and my goals-->

      <p>My University degree is in Cultural Anthropology and I studied photography in NYC. I started out as a photojournalist, became a multi-media producer, content creator, a founder of a few content-based startups, then content producer for large institutions such as Microsoft, NYU, and Amazon.</p>

      <p> Something was missing. I wanted to keep building things, though I wanted to influence functionality and user experience along with directing visual communication.
      </p>

      <p>My interest in code began when I really wanted something to be green instead of blue on a Wordpress site. I tweaked the CSS code, it worked, and this piqued my interest. A few years later I was managing a website for a hackathon project, wanted our site to have a cool favicon, and to figure it out myself. I found the code and directions on Wikipedia, entered the code, saved the HTML file and hit refresh. When the red favicon appeared I was stunned. It felt like I had performed magic and wanted more.
      </p>

      <p>My goals with learning code are to include front end web development and a deeper understanding of Agile, UX to my current skill set of visual content powerhouse. I am passionate about building things that work well, and are what users really want. Above all, I care a lot about good design.</p>

      <p>Below is a guissing game that shows am not terribly boring. </p>
